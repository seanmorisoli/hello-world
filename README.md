# hello-world
This is my work for Skills Lab 6!

This project takes in a user's inputted name and their favorite type of food. If the inputted type of food is "Chinese," then the program will prompt the user to input a list of their favorite chinese dishes to be printed out in a list. If the inputted type of food is anything but "Chinese," the program will say that the user is incorrect in their choice.

Usage: 

After cloning the repository using 'git clone', follow the text prompts instructing you what inputs to enter.
