This program takes in two inputs: one for the user's name, and one for their favorite type of food.
If the user inputs anything other than Chinese food for their favorite type of food, the program 
corrects the user, saying that their favorite food is chinese food. Otherwise, if the user inputs
Chinese food as their favorite type of food, the program says the user is correct.
